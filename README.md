# Open-Rhein-Main 2022 Talk by Nils Knappmeier

## Title:

The ultimate web-frontend setup

## Abstract:

In the last twenty years web-frontends have grown from simple server-generated HTML
pages to full-blown applications that run a lot of code in the browser.
Managing this complexity is a challenge, but luckily a lot of tools like "eslint" have evolved over
the years. Those tools help us build and optimize our web-app, maintain the quality
of our code, and reduce the number of mistakes we make.

In this talk, Nils will present you his favorite field-tested tools that
should be part of every new frontend setup.

## Some information about the author and presenter:

With over 15 years of professional experience as a web developer,
Nils has a passion for automated tests and clean code.
He has been working as a full stack engineer at cosee since 2019.
